 # Feature ideas

 # Changes to make
 - make the league sorting based on the games that are played in that day for example if only UCL games are in that day then the filter can only be UCL
 - use auth in more places
 - make a nicer loader
 - make the navigation smoother after login 
 - maybe add toasts
 - add error handling for auth cases (make some research here)
 - make the statistics nicer in code

# Before official release
 - remove all console.logs
